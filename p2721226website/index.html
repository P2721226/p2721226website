    <p style=" font-size: 30px;  font-family: Arial,
     Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 40px;">Leicester City Football Club is an English professional football club based in Leicester.
Founded in 1884, the club has a long and rich history, having won a number of trophies
throughout the years. The club first rose to prominence in the 1920s, winning their first major
trophy in the 1924–25 season. That season, they won the FA Cup, beating Cardiff City 1–0
in the final. They then went on to win a second FA Cup in 1928–29, defeating Bolton
Wanderers 2–0 in the final. This success was followed by their first Division One title in the
1928–29 season, finishing the season with a record points total of 58. Leicester City then
went on to win the League Cup in 1964, beating Stoke City 4–3 in the final. This was
followed by another League Cup win in 1997, this time against Middlesbrough. They also
won the Charity Shield in 1971, beating Manchester City 2–1. </p>
     <p style=" font-size: 30px;  font-family: Arial,
     Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 40px">In more recent times, Leicester City have been crowned champions of England for the first
time in the 2015–16 season, a remarkable achievement considering they were outside of the
top four the previous season. Leicester City’s remarkable success in winning the English
Premier League in the 2015-2016 season is one of the greatest sporting stories of all time.
After five years in the Premier League, Leicester City had been on the brink of relegation the
season before, and were given 5000-1 odds to win the title. However, with a combination of
strong team unity, an innovative tactical approach and some good luck, Leicester City
achieved the impossible and earned a place in history. The club has competed in 5 FA cup
Finals and have only recently won their first one in 2021.</p>
